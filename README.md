# Algorytmy-numeryczne

Numerical algorithms

1) Approximation error comparison for different types of series additions in function sinus:

<br/>a)Taylor series with summing from n = 1 / Ascending n
<br/>b)Taylor series with summing from n = 15 / Descending n
<br/>c)Taylor series with summing n = (n+1)/n

<br/>2) Linear problems solved using custom matrix body class with operators and Gauss,Gauss-Seidel,Jacobi algorithms + Eigen library.
<br/>Work in progress.

3) Solving complex probability matrices with different algorithms with testing method MonteCarlo.<br/>

    Game is meant to create a board with places placed in such order  -N..0..N where P1 starts from -N and P2 starts from N. 
    Players gather shrooms throughout the game which are placed randomly on board with uniform distribution. 1 shroom can be on 1 field.
    Player who has more shrooms when one of the players steps on spot 0 wins.

    Program is creating matrix of states from game's all possible moves and counting chances of P1 win percentage depending on variables n & k
    n - number of fields
    k - number of mushrooms placed

4) Least-squares function approximation for time from solving linear problems: 
Gauss,Gauss-Seidel,Jacobi algorithms as well as Eigen functions

Using game from project 3 made without mushrooms, just possibilities of movement P1|P2 as data.
